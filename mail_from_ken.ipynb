    "\n",
    "One of the most common problems companies face is CEO impersonation attacks. This is a form of fraud where a scammer sends an email purporting to be from the CEO of a company or another senior executive and commonly requesting the finance team to make a payment to a third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge we're going to use machine learning to automatically detect if an email from a person is legitimate. For that purpose we're going to use the corpus of emails from Enron. You can learn more about the [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) scandal in the Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that you're a worker from Enron in the year 2000 and you receive an email from the boss [Ken Lay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Lay) asking you to pay a huge invoice. Fortunately you have access to the email servers files and you can use machine learning to find out if the email is genuine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following Colab notebook to create a feature vector of 3000 features for each email in the Enron dataset. Populate each feature with the number of times each of the 3000 most frequent English words appears in the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards train a classifier to detect Ken's emails and provide a confusion matrix of the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience we have already labeled Ken's emails in the dataset and extracted the body of the emails in a separate column."
